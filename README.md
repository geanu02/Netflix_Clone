# Streaming Service Web Application

## My version of Netflix

Built the frontend UI of Netflix utilizing React, StyledComponents and Firebase Auth that enable user
authentication, search film and series titles and play media.
Applied modern web standards in Responsive Design in developing a Single-Page Application (SPA) using
JavaScript ES6+ and React.js functional compound components, router and built-in/custom hooks.
Deployed web application in Netlify through Github to enable CI/CD.
